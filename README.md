# Advanced-Regression-Assignment

## Introduction
This assignment contains two parts. Part-I is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter Notebook), and 
Part-II includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file). 


## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
## Business Goal:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
## Conclusion:
These variables are significant in predicting the price of a house :

OverallCon::Rates the overall condition of the house
GrLivArea::Above grade (ground) living area square feet
BsmtFullBath::Basement full bathrooms
LotConfig_FR3::Lot configuration- Frontage on 3 sides of property
2ndFlrSF::Second floor square feet
MSSubClass ::Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.
HalfBath ::Half baths above grade
LotConfig_Insid::Lot configuration-Inside lot
Fireplaces ::Number of fireplaces
LandContour_Low:Flatness of the property Depression

Best alpha value for Lasso : 0.001

Best alpha value for Ridge : 5.0
